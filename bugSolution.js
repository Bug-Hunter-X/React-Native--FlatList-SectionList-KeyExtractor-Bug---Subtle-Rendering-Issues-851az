To solve this issue, ensure your `keyExtractor` function always returns a unique string for every item in your data array. The best approach is to use an existing unique identifier within the data object itself. 

```javascript
const data = [{ id: 1, name: 'Item 1' }, { id: 2, name: 'Item 2' }];

// Correct keyExtractor
<FlatList
  data={data}
  renderItem={({ item }) => <Text>{item.name}</Text>}
  keyExtractor={(item) => item.id.toString()} // Correct: Uses a unique ID
/>
```

If your data objects don't have a unique identifier, you'll need to add one.  Alternatively, you can generate a UUID for each item; however, using an existing unique ID is generally preferred for performance reasons.
