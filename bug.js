In React Native, when working with FlatList or SectionList, an uncommon error can arise if you're not properly handling the `keyExtractor` prop. If the keys generated aren't unique for each item, you might encounter unexpected behavior, including incorrect rendering, data duplication, or performance issues. The error messages might be subtle or not directly point to the `keyExtractor` problem. For example, you might see random item re-renders or see items in the wrong order. Consider the example of a FlatList rendering an array of objects. If the array is mutated directly and not by replacing the original array, React may not re-render correctly.  Here's an example:

```javascript
const data = [{ id: 1, name: 'Item 1' }, { id: 2, name: 'Item 2' }];

// Incorrect keyExtractor
<FlatList
  data={data}
  renderItem={({ item }) => <Text>{item.name}</Text>}
  keyExtractor={(item, index) => index} // Incorrect: index can change if data is reordered
/>
```
